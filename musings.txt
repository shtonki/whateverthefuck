Known bug: GUIComponents are rendered before GameEntities so we end up with GameEntities on top of our GUI

Known bug: Context handling doesn't actually handle the context.

Suspected bug: Network thread keeps running in background after window is closed so our program doesn't exit forcing me to restart my console making me a very angry boy

Known bug: Healthbars don't realize shit's dead until one step after so when we severly overkill something the healthbar bugs the fuck out and gets bigger than my pp. This has sorta been fixed by health no longer going beneath 0.

Known bug: We sometimes don't realize we sync on the same tick since either the server or more likely the client captures the tick which is synced incorrectly.

Known bug: We can begin casting an ability when we're dead but it makes no progress.

Known bug: We get weird af disagreements on syncs because A: we send the wrong tick, and B: we think that two SyncRecords which actually agree disagree

Known bug: We sometime crash on startup getting a bungled GameEvent of type NotSet. This is especially common when debugging.

Known bug: Ability cooldowns reset to full duration of the player casts another spell.
