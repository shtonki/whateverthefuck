Known stinky code: Clean up GameEvent so internals are usable to the GameState and handle conversion somewhere else.

Known bug: Hero will jitter around like a three year old on adderall sometimes.

Known bug: GUIComponents are rendered before GameEntities so we end up with GameEntities on top of our GUI

Suspected bug: Network thread keeps running in background after window is closed so our program doesn't exit forcing me to restart my console making me a very angry boy
